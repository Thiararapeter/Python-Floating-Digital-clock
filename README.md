   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Create the standalone executable and folder:

   ```bash

   ```

   Replace `your_script.py` with the actual filename of your Python script.

3. Locate the generated files:

   After running the command, find a folder named `my_folder` in your script's directory. Inside that folder, you'll find the standalone executable and any necessary files.
